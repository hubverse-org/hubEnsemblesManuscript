\title{Reformat model outputs stored as a \code{model_output_tbl} class to that of a
\code{data.frame} formatted according to standards of the COVID-19 Forecasting
Hub which can be processed by functions from the \code{covidHubUtils} package
such as \code{score_forecasts()} or \code{plot_forecasts()}. The supplied
\code{model_output_tbl} should have columns defining properties akin to
reference dates, locations, horizons, and targets.}
\usage{
as_covid_hub_forecasts(model_outputs)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_outputs}{an object of class \code{model_output_tbl} with component
model outputs (e.g., predictions). Should have columns containing the
following information: model name, reference date, location, horizon,
target, output type, output type id, and value. The target column should
contain targets of the form "(temporal resolution) (target)" or
"(temporal resolution) ahead (target)", such as "wk ahead inc flu hosp"
"wk inc flu hosp", to properly create a temporal resolution column.}
}
\value{
a \code{data.frame} of reformatted model outputs that may be fed into
any of the \code{covidHubUtils} functions with 10 total columns: model,
forecast_date, location, horizon, temporal_resolution, target_variable,
target_end_date, type, quantile, value.
